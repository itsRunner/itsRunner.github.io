## General info
Just a simple javascript blackjack made by me. This is actually my second javascript project.
	
## How does it work?
The script creates a deck of 52 cards which are then shuffled by the shuffleDeck function. After that the cards are drawn from the deck from last to first. Then points are given to dealer/player with the function addPoints which after the points are added removes the card that was drawn from the deck (cards). After that the player has an option either to "Hold" their current cards or to "Hit" aka draw another card from the deck. Whoever has the most points wins the game.
